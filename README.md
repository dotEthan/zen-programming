# Zenful Programming

Github URL (You're here!): https://github.com/dotEthan/zen-programming

## Built With

- Next.JS,
- TailwindCSS
- React Testing Library

### Status

Testing and designing currently.

## Overview and Thoughts

### Why Next.js?

 - Next.js is overkill, I am aware there are better ways to create this site, I chose Next.Js because while I've worked with React, I haven't worked with Next.JS and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. 
 
### Why this site in general?

 - I love helping and mentoring others and the more I learn the more I want to have a place to put it all for others to learn from as well.  

### What's Working

Basic site format up and running

### What isn't working

- So far all is good.

## Where are we?

### Working (not feature complete, full design still in progress):

- Create Repo
- Basic stucture up and working

### Working on Now:

- Organizing error handling
- Moving towards Full Test Driven Development (TDD) practices

### To Come:

- Full test suite
- Sorting Types
