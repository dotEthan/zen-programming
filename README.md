## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

This Readme seems to be working.

### What isn't working

- So far all is good.

### Why?

I find the more sense I use to learn something the better I am at remembering it, so if I can take the time and effort to create examples of these concepts, it would be pretty hard for them to be forgotten.

Using Next.js as I haven't and I hear good things. I also have some long term thoughts for this site that will require more server side code so Next.js will help there a lot.
